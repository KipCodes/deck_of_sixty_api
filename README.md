# The Deck of Sixty Tarot Reader
This is a project I began and kept dropping over the last two years. This repo is my attempt to start fresh and practice some coding.

This API is intended to allow users to generate tarot spreads based on a deck called 'The Deck of Sixty' that exists within the MMORPG game Final Fantasy XIV.

Use it for roleplay! Or just use it just for fun!

# About and Credits
Since there are no in-game references to the types of cards included in the deck beyond the major arcana and the referenced Lord and Lady of Crowns, the remainder of the deck included in this app has been designed with creative liberty. Is there actually a suit of irons? Who knows! Is there a knave tier in each suit? No clue! But this design worked for the purpose of creating a fully-formed deck including a total of 60 cards, so this is how it is for now pending new revelations provided by Square Enix for their possible design.

I would be remiss to not include the initial inspiration for my deck's design: a tumblr post by one Yourou that I stumbled upon while searching for concepts of a fully-fledged deck of sixty. In this post they laid out their own version of the deck of sixty, including interpretations for the major and minor arcana within their deck. Many of these meanings behind the cards I thought were well furnished and great on their own, while others I myself modified to better include a range of meanings for better readings and interpretations. The specific post that I found inspiration in can be found here: https://yourou-ffxiv.tumblr.com/post/125812463927/astrologian-and-role-play-a-guide-on-how-to

And of course, this deck is ever evolving based on input and feedback from my fellow players as well as additional insight provided through official developments by Square Enix.
